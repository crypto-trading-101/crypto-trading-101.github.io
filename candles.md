##### [Candlestick Charts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp)
  * Candlestick charts display the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a specific period.
  * Candlesticks with long real bodies show conviction.

##### [Evening Star](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eveningstar.asp)
  * An evening star is a candlestick pattern used by technical analysts to predict future price reversals to the downside.
  * Although it is rare, the evening star pattern is considered by traders to be a reliable technical indicator.
  * The evening star is the opposite of the morning star pattern. The two are bearish and bullish indicators, respectively.

##### [Morning Star](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/morningstar.asp)
  * A morning star is a visual pattern made up of a tall black candlestick, a smaller black or white candlestick with a short body and long wicks, and a third tall white candlestick.
  * The middle candle of the morning star captures a moment of market indecision where the bears begin to give way to bulls. The third candle confirms the reversal and can mark a new uptrend.
  * The opposite pattern to a morning star is the evening star, which signals a reversal of an uptrend into a downtrend.

##### [Shooting Star](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shootingstar.asp)
  * A shooting star occurs after an advance and indicates the price could start falling.
  * The formation is bearish because the price tried to rise significantly during the day, but then the sellers took over and pushed the price back down toward the open.
  * Traders typically wait to see what the next candle (period) does following a shooting star. If the price declines during the next period they may sell or short.
  * If the price rises after a shooting star, the formation may have been a false signal or the candle is marking a potential resistance area around the price range of the candle.

##### [Hammer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hammer.asp)
  * Hammer candlesticks typically occur after a price decline. They have a small real body and a long lower shadow.
  * The hammer candlestick occurs when sellers enter the market during a price decline. By the time of market close, buyers absorb selling pressure and push the market price near the opening price.
  * The close can be above or below the opening price, although the close should be near the open in order for the real body of the candlestick to remain small.
  * The lower shadow should be at least two times the height of the real body.
  * Hammer candlesticks indicate a potential price reversal to the upside. The price must start moving up following the hammer; this is called confirmation.

##### [Spinning Top](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinning-top.asp)
  * A spinning top is a candlestick pattern that has a short real body that's vertically centered between long upper and lower shadows
  * The real body should be small, showing little difference between the open and close prices.
  * Since buyers and sellers both pushed the price, but couldn't maintain it, the pattern shows indecision and that more sideways movement could follow.

##### [Doji](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp)
  * A doji is a name for a session in which the candlestick for a security has an open and close that are virtually equal and are often components in patterns.
  * Alone, doji are neutral patterns that are also featured in a number of important patterns.
  * Doji formations come in three major types: gravestone, long-legged, and dragonfly.

##### [Gravestone Doji](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gravestone-doji.asp)
  * A gravestone doji is a bearish pattern that suggests a reversal followed by a downtrend in the price action.
  * A gravestone pattern can be used as a sign to take profits on a bullish position or enter a bearish trade.
  * The opposite of a gravestone doji is a dragonfly doji.

##### [Long-Legged Doji](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-legged-doji.asp)
  * The long-legged doji is a candlestick that consists of long upper and lower shadows and has approximately the same opening and closing price.
  * The pattern shows indecision and is most significant when it occurs after a strong advance or decline.
  * While some traders may act on the one-candle pattern, others want to see what the price does after the long-legged doji.
  * The pattern is not always significant, and won't always mark the end of a trendâ€”it could mark the start of a consolidation period, or it may just end up being an insignificant blip in the current trend.

##### [Dragonfly Doji](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dragonfly-doji.asp)
  * A dragonfly doji can occur after a price rise or a price decline.
  * The open, high, and close prices match each other, and the low of the period is significantly lower than the former three. This creates a "T" shape.
  * The appearance of a dragonfly doji after a price advance warns of a potential price decline. A move lower on the next candle provides confirmation.
  * A dragonfly doji after a price decline warns the price may rise. If the next candle rises that provides confirmation.
  * Candlestick traders typically wait for the confirmation candle before acting on the dragonfly doji.
