<ul>

  <li>Candlesticks with long real bodies show conviction.

<h5 id="evening-starhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermseeveningstarasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eveningstar.asp">Evening Star</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>An evening star is a candlestick pattern used by technical analysts to predict future price reversals to the downside.</li>
  <li>Although it is rare, the evening star pattern is considered by traders to be a reliable technical indicator.</li>
  <li>The evening star is the opposite of the morning star pattern. The two are bearish and bullish indicators, respectively.

</ul>

<h5 id="morning-starhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsmmorningstarasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/morningstar.asp">Morning Star</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A morning star is a visual pattern made up of a tall black candlestick, a smaller black or white candlestick with a short body and long wicks, and a third tall white candlestick.</li>
  <li>The middle candle of the morning star captures a moment of market indecision where the bears begin to give way to bulls. The third candle confirms the reversal and can mark a new uptrend.</li>
  <li>The opposite pattern to a morning star is the evening star, which signals a reversal of an uptrend into a downtrend.

</ul>

<h5 id="shooting-starhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermssshootingstarasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shootingstar.asp">Shooting Star</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A shooting star occurs after an advance and indicates the price could start falling.</li>
  <li>The formation is bearish because the price tried to rise significantly during the day, but then the sellers took over and pushed the price back down toward the open.</li>
  <li>Traders typically wait to see what the next candle (period) does following a shooting star. If the price declines during the next period they may sell or short.</li>
  <li>If the price rises after a shooting star, the formation may have been a false signal or the candle is marking a potential resistance area around the price range of the candle.

</ul>

<h5 id="hammerhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermshhammerasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hammer.asp">Hammer</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>Hammer candlesticks typically occur after a price decline. They have a small real body and a long lower shadow.</li>
  <li>The hammer candlestick occurs when sellers enter the market during a price decline. By the time of market close, buyers absorb selling pressure and push the market price near the opening price.</li>
  <li>The close can be above or below the opening price, although the close should be near the open in order for the real body of the candlestick to remain small.</li>
  <li>The lower shadow should be at least two times the height of the real body.</li>
  <li>Hammer candlesticks indicate a potential price reversal to the upside. The price must start moving up following the hammer; this is called confirmation.

</ul>

<h5 id="spinning-tophttpswwwinvestopediacomtermssspinning-topasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinning-top.asp">Spinning Top</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A spinning top is a candlestick pattern that has a short real body that’s vertically centered between long upper and lower shadows</li>
  <li>The real body should be small, showing little difference between the open and close prices.</li>
  <li>Since buyers and sellers both pushed the price, but couldn’t maintain it, the pattern shows indecision and that more sideways movement could follow.

</ul>

<h5 id="dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsddojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp">Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A doji is a name for a session in which the candlestick for a security has an open and close that are virtually equal and are often components in patterns.</li>
  <li>Alone, doji are neutral patterns that are also featured in a number of important patterns.</li>
  <li>Doji formations come in three major types: gravestone, long-legged, and dragonfly.
<img src="/images/doji.png" alt="doji" /></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="gravestone-dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsggravestone-dojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gravestone-doji.asp">Gravestone Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A gravestone doji is a bearish pattern that suggests a reversal followed by a downtrend in the price action.</li>
  <li>A gravestone pattern can be used as a sign to take profits on a bullish position or enter a bearish trade.</li>
  <li>The opposite of a gravestone doji is a dragonfly doji.
<img src="/images/gravestone-doji.png" alt="gravestone-doji" /></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="long-legged-dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsllong-legged-dojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-legged-doji.asp">Long-Legged Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>The long-legged doji is a candlestick that consists of long upper and lower shadows and has approximately the same opening and closing price.</li>
  <li>The pattern shows indecision and is most significant when it occurs after a strong advance or decline.</li>
  <li>While some traders may act on the one-candle pattern, others want to see what the price does after the long-legged doji.</li>
  <li>The pattern is not always significant, and won’t always mark the end of a trend—it could mark the start of a consolidation period, or it may just end up being an insignificant blip in the current trend.

</ul>

<h5 id="dragonfly-dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsddragonfly-dojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dragonfly-doji.asp">Dragonfly Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A dragonfly doji can occur after a price rise or a price decline.</li>
  <li>The open, high, and close prices match each other, and the low of the period is significantly lower than the former three. This creates a “T” shape.</li>
  <li>The appearance of a dragonfly doji after a price advance warns of a potential price decline. A move lower on the next candle provides confirmation.</li>
  <li>A dragonfly doji after a price decline warns the price may rise. If the next candle rises that provides confirmation.</li>
  <li>Candlestick traders typically wait for the confirmation candle before acting on the dragonfly doji.
