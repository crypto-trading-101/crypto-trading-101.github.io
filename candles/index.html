<h5 id="shooting-starhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermssshootingstarasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shootingstar.asp">Shooting Star</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>Shooting star indicates the price could start falling.</li>
  <li>The formation is bearish because the price tried to rise significantly, sellers took over and pushed the price back down toward the open.</li>
  <li>Wait to see what the next candle does following a shooting star. If price declines on next candle you may want to sell or short.</li>

<h5 id="hammerhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermshhammerasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hammer.asp">Hammer</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>Hammer candlesticks occur usually after a price decline.</li>
  <li>Hammer candlestick occurs when sellers enter the market during a price decline. By the time of market close, buyers absorb selling pressure and push the market price near the opening price.</li>
  <li>Hammer candlesticks indicate a potential price reversal to the upside. The price must start moving up following the hammer; this is called confirmation.

<h5 id="spinning-tophttpswwwinvestopediacomtermssspinning-topasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinning-top.asp">Spinning Top</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A spinning top is a candlestick pattern that has a short real body that’s vertically centered between long upper and lower shadows</li>
  <li>The real body should be small, showing little difference between the open and close prices.</li>
  <li>Since buyers and sellers both pushed the price, but couldn’t maintain it, the pattern shows indecision and that more sideways movement could follow.

<h5 id="dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsddojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp">Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A doji is a name for a session in which the candlestick for a security has an open and close that are virtually equal and are often components in patterns.</li>
  <li>Alone, doji are neutral patterns that are also featured in a number of important patterns.</li>
  <li>Doji formations come in three major types: gravestone, long-legged, and dragonfly.

</ul>

<h5 id="gravestone-dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsggravestone-dojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gravestone-doji.asp">Gravestone Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A gravestone doji is a bearish pattern that suggests a reversal followed by a downtrend in the price action.</li>
  <li>A gravestone pattern can be used as a sign to take profits on a bullish position or enter a bearish trade.</li>
  <li>The opposite of a gravestone doji is a dragonfly doji.

</ul>

<h5 id="long-legged-dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsllong-legged-dojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-legged-doji.asp">Long-Legged Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>The long-legged doji is a candlestick that consists of long upper and lower shadows and has approximately the same opening and closing price.</li>
  <li>The pattern shows indecision and is most significant when it occurs after a strong advance or decline.</li>
  <li>While some traders may act on the one-candle pattern, others want to see what the price does after the long-legged doji.</li>
  <li>The pattern is not always significant, and won’t always mark the end of a trend—it could mark the start of a consolidation period, or it may just end up being an insignificant blip in the current trend.

</ul>

<h5 id="dragonfly-dojihttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsddragonfly-dojiasp"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dragonfly-doji.asp">Dragonfly Doji</a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>A dragonfly doji can occur after a price rise or a price decline.</li>
  <li>The open, high, and close prices match each other, and the low of the period is significantly lower than the former three. This creates a “T” shape.</li>
  <li>The appearance of a dragonfly doji after a price advance warns of a potential price decline. A move lower on the next candle provides confirmation.</li>
  <li>A dragonfly doji after a price decline warns the price may rise. If the next candle rises that provides confirmation.</li>
  <li>Candlestick traders typically wait for the confirmation candle before acting on the dragonfly doji.
