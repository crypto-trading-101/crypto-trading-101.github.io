#### Exchange
You will need Centralized Exchange(CEX) that connect to your bank.
You will need to setup up account with one of following.

  * [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) - I prefer!  It's fast for deposits/withdrawals.
  * [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/us/) - I do not have account.
  * [binance.us](https://www.binance.us) - Cheap trade fees.  Good for Spot Trading.  Best for noobs!


Decentralized Dxchange(DEX) for Leverage Trading in USA. Use e-mail option when you register!  Do not use phone number!

  * [bingx](http://bingx.com) - Offer fake $ for practice and Low fees!
  * [primexbt](http://primexbt.com) - Nice Bonus and Low fees!
  * [phemex](https://phemex.com/) - Good for Spot Trading  Offers free Spot Trading fees with membership.

I prefer LTF Trading with leverage.  I use [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) to buy Bitcoin and send to DEX exchange.  To withdrawal.  I'll send Bitcoin from DEX exchange to [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/).
