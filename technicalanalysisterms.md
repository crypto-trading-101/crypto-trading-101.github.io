##### [Support (Support Level)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp)
  * The support level represents a price point that an asset struggles to fall below over a given time period.
  * Support levels can be visualized using different technical indicators or simply by drawing a line connecting the lowest lows for the period.
  * Applying trendlines or incorporating moving averages provides a more dynamic view of support.
  * You do not know how to find support you have no business trading!

##### [Resistance (Resistance Level)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp)  
  * A resistance level represents a price point that an asset has had trouble exceeding in the time period being considered.
  * Resistance can visualized using different technical indicators rather than simply drawing a line connecting highs.
  * Applying trendlines to a chart can provide a more dynamic view of resistance.
  * You do not know where resistance is you have no business trading!

##### [Confirmation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation.asp)
  * Confirmation can refer to either a broker's written acknowledgment of trade completion or else the use of an additional technical indicator to substantiate a trend suggested by one indicator.
  * Two different technical indicators, such as volume or moving averages, help establish the prevalence of a trend for traders.
  * Confirmation of trends can be susceptible to confirmation bias.

##### [Volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp)
  * Volume is the number of shares of a security traded during a given period of time.
  * Volume is an important indicator in technical analysis because it is used to measure the relative significance of a market move.
  * The higher the volume during a price move, the more significant the move and the lower the volume during a price move, the less significant the move.

##### [Breakout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp)
  * A breakout is when the price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level.

##### [Trend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp)
  * A trend is the general direction of the price of a market, asset, or metric.

##### [Uptrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp)
  * Uptrends are characterized by higher peaks and troughs over time and imply bullish sentiment among investors.

##### [Downtrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp)
  * Downtrends are characterized by lower peaks and troughs and imply fundamental changes in the beliefs of investors.

##### [Trendline](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendline.asp)
  * Trendlines indicate the best fit of some data using a single line or curve.
  * A single trendline can be applied to a chart to give a clearer picture of the trend.
  * Trendlines can be applied to the highs and the lows to create a channel.
  * The time period being analyzed and the exact points used to create a trendline vary from trader to trader.

##### [Swing High](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinghigh.asp)
  * A swing high is a technical indicator signaled by a price peak followed by a decline.
  * Higher swing highs are associated with uptrends, and lower swing highs are associated with downtrends or a loss of momentum in the uptrend.
  * How far swing highs are apart may provide insight into trend strength. A swing high that is much higher than the prior swing highs shows buyers are eager to get in.
  * Swing highs are useful for determining trend direction and strength and entering or exiting trades. They are also applicable to analyzing indicators.

##### [Swing Low](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinglow.asp)
  * Marking the trough in fluctuation prices, swing lows are a visually obvious low point in a given collection of trading periods.
  * The relative low point in the last 20 or so trading periods will likely be identified as the swing low.
  * Swing lows are subjective to the time frame of the observer.

##### [Peak](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peak.asp)
  * A peak is the highest point of a business cycle and is followed by a contraction and eventual trough.

##### [Trough](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trough.asp)
  * A trough, in economic terms, can refer to a stage in the business cycle where activity is bottoming, or where prices are bottoming, before a rise.

##### [Price Action](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp)
  * Price action generally refers to the up and down movement of a security's price when it is plotted over time.
  * Different looks can be applied to a chart to make trends in price action more obvious for traders.
  * Technical analysis formations and chart patterns are derived from price action. Technical analysis tools like moving averages are calculated from price action and projected into the future to inform trades.

##### [Reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp)
  * A reversal is when the direction of a price trend has changed, from going up to going down, or vice-versa.
  * Traders try to get out of positions that are aligned with the trend prior to a reversal, or they will get out once they see the reversal underway.
  * Reversals typically refer to large price changes, where the trend changes direction. Small counter-moves against the trend are called pullbacks or consolidations.
  * When it starts to occur, a reversal isn't distinguishable from a pullback. A reversal keeps going and forms a new trend, while a pullback ends and then the price starts moving back in the trending direction.

##### [Consolidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp)
  * Consolidation is term used to describe price movement within a given support and resistance range for a period of time.
  * It is generally caused due to trader indecisiveness.

##### [Volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp)
  * Volatility represents how large an asset's prices swing around the mean priceâ€”it is a statistical measure of its dispersion of returns.
  * Crypto trading often considered riskier than less volatile assets like stock because the crypto market is expected to be less predictable.

##### [Dispersion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dispersion.asp)
  * Dispersion refers to the range of potential outcomes of investments based on historical volatility or returns.
  * Generally speaking, the higher the dispersion, the riskier an investment is, and vice versa.

##### [Variance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp)
* Variance is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set.
* Investors use variance to see how much risk an investment carries and whether it will be profitable.
